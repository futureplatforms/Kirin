The Android Kirin Fragment and Activity classes depend on the Android support libraries. 
This means you're required to have them in your Maven repository. 
To be able to set this up you need to download the 'Android Support Repository' Android SDK Manager (located in Extras). 
The files will be located in the android-sdk/extras/android/m2repository directory. 
Copy those files into your local repo and Maven will be able to locate them at build time.
